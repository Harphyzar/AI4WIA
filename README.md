This project encompasses an in-depth analysis and prediction model development for agricultural yield. The datasets which was utilized in this analysis include information regarding pesticides, temperature, rainfall, and historical yield data. It was gotten from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelris/crop-yield-prediction-dataset. The primary aim is to predict crop yield based on various factors such as temperature, pesticide usage, and environmental conditions. Although, we couldn't get data that speak to the Nigerian Ecosystem, we deem it necessary to use the available data to serve as a template for future work.
